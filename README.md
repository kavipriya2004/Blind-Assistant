# Blind Assistant

A desktop application that combines text-to-speech (TTS), speech-to-text (STT), and PDF reading functionalities. The application uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and integrates with text-to-speech and speech recognition libraries to assist visually impaired users.

## Features

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Convert entered text to spoken words using pyttsx3.
- **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Recognize spoken words and convert them to text using SpeechRecognition.
- **PDF Reading:** Extract text from PDF files and convert it to speech using gTTS.
- **Interactive GUI:** A simple Tkinter-based interface for user interaction.

## Installation

To get started with the Blind Assistant, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can then install the required libraries using pip.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blind-assistant.git
cd blind-assistant
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition gTTS PyPDF2
```

## Usage

### Running the GUI Application

To use the Tkinter-based GUI application:

1. Navigate to the directory where your `main_gui.py` file is located.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main_gui.py
   ```

   This will open a Tkinter window where you can enter text and click the "Speak" button to hear it spoken aloud.

### Running the Voice Assistant

To use the voice assistant functionality:

1. Ensure you have a PDF file available at `G:\\OVER ALL PROPER CODES\\sample,py.pdf`.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python looping.py
   ```

   The voice assistant will listen for commands and respond to specific phrases, such as "hello," "what's the time," and "read." It will read text from the specified PDF file and convert it to audio.

## Code Structure

- `main_gui.py`: Contains the Tkinter-based GUI application for text-to-speech functionality.
- `looping.py`: Implements the speech-to-text functionality and integrates with PDF reading and text-to-speech.

## Dependencies
